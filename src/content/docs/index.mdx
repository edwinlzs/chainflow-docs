    Compose your own API workflow scripts to manipulate the state of your app
    and data to speed up your development.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Setup your test data" icon="add-document">
    Use fewer SQL scripts to setup data for tests or demos. Leverage your
    backend APIs to ensure important app logic and side effects are run
    properly!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simulate your frontend" icon="laptop">
    Run UI-agnostic end-to-end API tests - treat an API call workflow as if it
